# ðŸ’¾ Analyzer service
This service runs constantly in the background and processes samples that require analysis as soon as they're detected.

## Models
AI models are stored as [Pickle-serialized files](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html).
Because some of them are several hundred megabytes in size, we cannot commit them to this Git repository,
and [LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) is neither a suitable option as we're broke.

Instead, this service **automatically downloads** the model files from a remote OneDrive shared directory when the image
is built.

During development, you can drop custom model files at the [./models](./models) directory to test the new versions
instead of using the production-ready files downloaded from OneDrive.
See the main [README](../README.md) to learn more about how to run this app locally.
